# Faerie Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a variant of rock-paper-scissors I made for JetBrains Academy called faerie-rps. It has 2 modes: traditional rock-paper-scissors as well as an arbitary number of user defined choices.


USAGE:

1. Enter your name
2. Enter your options. If this is left blank, then it will default to standard rock-paper-scissor
3. To see your score, type '!rating'
4. To exit the game, type '!exit'
